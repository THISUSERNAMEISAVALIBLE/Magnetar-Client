## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

>**Q: My plants are invincible even though I have God Mode Plants turned off, or they are stacking without Plant Anywhere enabled. How do I fix this?** <br>
**A:** Ensure you are using the correct version of the mod. Game versions must exactly match the mod versions (e.g., 3.6.x mod versions are only compatible with game versions 3.6.x).
